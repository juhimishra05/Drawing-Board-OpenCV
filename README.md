# 🎨 Virtual Drawing Board — OpenCV + MediaPipe Project

Draw anything on the screen with your **index finger** — no stylus, no touchscreen, just your webcam and your hand! ✍️🖐️  
This real-time gesture-based drawing app is powered by **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** using hand landmarks and finger detection.

## 🧠 How It Works

🖐️ This project uses your webcam to detect hand gestures and switches between drawing and selection modes based on finger positions:

- ☝️ **Only Index Finger Up** → Drawing Mode
- ✌️ **Index + Middle Finger Up** → Selection Mode (choose color or eraser)
- ✋ **All 5 Fingers Up** → Clear the entire drawing board

You can toggle between different **colors** and an **eraser** by moving your fingers to the top toolbar area.
